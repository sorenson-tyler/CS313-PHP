I have been involved in The Boy Scouts of America for about all my life. My parents had to push me to start, but once I committed I loved it. In 2011 I was presented with the Eagle Scout award, the highest achievement or rank attainable in the scouting program. I learned valuable skills that have helped me to become a better man.
