In November of 2015 I started an intership with Navex Global, and love every second of it. Navex Global is an Ethics and Commpliance company that provides software to other businesses, in order to maintain their ethical standards as a company. I work developing test methods in the C# language for one of their software solutions. This job has taught me a ton about developing software, and has provided a great enviornment for me to get my feet wet.
